# Architecture Center Samples

This repo contains supporting code artifacts for [Cloud Architecture
Center](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/) references.

> [!NOTE]
> The code in this repo is not intended for production use.

# Running samples

Each folder in this repo holds a self-contained sample, implemented in
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

## Setup

We recommend using [Cloud
Shell](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/install-configure-terraform#cloud-shell),
which comes pre-configured with Terraform and automatic authentication.

To run a sample:

 1. Clone this repo:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/architecture-center-samples
      ```

 1. Go to the sample directory:

      ```bash
      cd architecture-center-samples/[SAMPLE]/
      ```

 1. Enable any required APIs as defined in the sample's README.
 1. Initialize and view the planned deployed resources:

      ```bash
      terraform init
      terraform plan
      ```

1. Apply the configuration, entering `yes` at the prompt:

      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

> [!NOTE]
> While every effort is taken to ensure the Terraform deploys first time,
> some resources may take time to become ready for additional configuration.
> If the first `terraform apply` fails due to resources not existing, wait a
> few minutes and try again.

commands](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform/basic-commands).

## Cleanup

 * Remove the resources that were created, entering `yes` at the prompt:

      ```bash
      terraform destory
      ```
